Current plan is to clean this up some, change namespace, POD the documentation, put into CPAN

The toolkit requires the following Perl modules:
Compress::Zlib - for compressing content data with Zlib/deflate algorithm;
XML::Parser - for parsing XML input;
Time::Local - for converting a series of time values into an integer;
Text::Wrap, Text::Tabs - for processing preformatted text.
File::Copy - for copying and renaming temporary files output generation.
Bit::Vector - for identifying LZW code-words in GIF images.

Current Limitations/Issues:
not setup for CPAN;

no use strict;

global namespace pollution that should be cleaned up

error handling is less than stellar

finicky about color depth of images

no mechanism for flowing text from one page to the next
